Using Python, this project creates a visual chart illustrating the trajectory of an object undergoing projectile motion. Using mathematical modeling and programming,
we plot the object's path, allowing users to interactively explore the effects of initial velocity, air resistance, mass, and angle.

Note: Please install matplotlib and follow the instruction (Refer : https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)

Thank You ;)
